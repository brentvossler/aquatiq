SocalBoat is a project that I have been working on for a few weeks. This is for small boat rental companies to manage their inventories and reservations and publish their rentals in an easy-to-navigate marketplace as an additional distribution channel. 

Site visitors will be able to find the perfect boat, invite friends to split payments and get out on the water much easier.

Most boat rental companies have static sites and extremely sub-par online rental systems and invetory listing.

SO FAR:
1. File structure and full-stack complete.
2. Deployed to Digital Ocean and SSH works.
3. Email functionality works with NodeMailer.
4. Login and registration system works.
5. Rental company can Create and Delete listings.
6. Listings appear in a marketplace.
7. Amazon S3 integration complete. S3 holds all images 

NEXT:
1. Need to be able to UPDATE/POST listings.
2. PAYEEZY API system currently in development to accept tokenized payments.
3. Extend functionality for Payeezy to be able to handle multiple credit cards and once full payment has been collected, send payments to SMBs.
4. Contact, About, etc... site-wide work to look more professional after minimal functionality has been completed.
5. When SMB deletes boat listing, need to also delete images from S3. So far, I only have the user uploading the images but not the ability to delete the files from S3 when they delete their listing from socalboat.com



to be continued ... Plenty more functionality to stay busy :) I am only human... but my superpowers are growing every day.
